    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last Updated: December 28, 2025</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>uc-remote</strong> mobile application (herein referred to as "the App"). By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <strong>Important Status Disclosure:</strong> uc-remote is an unofficial, third-party application. It is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Unfolded Circle.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Local Connectivity</h2>
    <p>The App operates primarily on your local area network (LAN) to communicate with your Unfolded Circle Remote. To provide these features, we access the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Network Access:</strong> We collect and use local IP addresses, MAC addresses, and device port information to discover and control your remote.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Identifiers:</strong> We collect hardware identifiers (e.g., Remote Serial Numbers) solely for device-to-device authentication and connection persistence.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Tokens:</strong> Tokens used to authorize commands with your hardware are stored locally on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Security & Encryption</h2>
    <p>We take the security of your home automation setup seriously:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encrypted Storage:</strong> Sensitive information, including authentication tokens and remote credentials, is stored on your device using <strong>AES-256 GCM Encrypted SharedPreferences</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Transit Security:</strong> While local communication with some hardware may occur over HTTP on Port 80, all data transmitted off the device to third-party services is encrypted using standard HTTPS/TLS protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App utilize third-party SDKs for performance and stability. These providers may collect data according to their own policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Crashlytics & Analytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. User Rights and Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Users have full control over their data. You can delete all locally stored remote configurations, tokens, and identifiers at any time by selecting the "Delete Remote" option within the App settings. This action immediately wipes all associated encrypted data from your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this policy or need to request a data review, please contact us at:</p>
